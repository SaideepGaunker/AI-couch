# Audio Analysis Feature Setup Guide

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Missing Schemas** ✅
- Created `backend/app/schemas/audio_analysis.py` with proper request/response models
- Defined `AudioAnalysisRequest`, `AudioAnalysisResponse`, and `AudioFeatures` schemas

### 2. **Missing CRUD Operations** ✅
- Created `backend/app/crud/performance_metrics.py` with functions:
  - `get_by_session_and_question()` - Find existing performance metrics
  - `create_with_tone_analysis()` - Create new metrics with tone data
  - `update_tone_confidence()` - Update existing metrics
  - `update_performance_metric()` - General update function

### 3. **Fixed Tone Analysis Service** ✅
- Completed the incomplete `tone_analysis_service.py`
- Added missing methods:
  - `get_confidence_score()` - Calculate overall confidence
  - `get_tone_score()` - Calculate overall tone quality
  - `analyze_complete_audio()` - Main analysis function
  - `_generate_improvement_suggestions()` - Generate personalized feedback
  - `_get_default_metrics()` - Default values when analysis fails

### 4. **Fixed API Endpoints** ✅
- Updated `audio_analysis.py` endpoint to use the correct service
- Fixed import statements and function calls
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Integrated with database storage

### 5. **Added to Main Router** ✅
- Added audio analysis router to main API router
- Available at `/api/v1/audio/*` endpoints

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/v1/audio/analyze`
Analyze uploaded audio file for tone and confidence.

**Parameters:**
- `audio_file`: Audio file (wav, mp3, m4a, flac, ogg, aac)
- `session_id`: (optional) Interview session ID
- `question_id`: (optional) Question ID

**Response:**
```json
{
  "tone_confidence_score": 75,
  "improvement_suggestions": "Good tone and confidence overall. Minor adjustments will make it even better.",
  "success": true,
  "message": "Audio analysis completed successfully"
}
```

### GET `/api/v1/audio/supported-formats`
Get supported audio formats and file size limits.

## How It Works

1. **Audio Upload**: User uploads audio file via API
2. **Feature Extraction**: System extracts audio features using librosa:
   - Voice stability (pitch analysis)
   - Voice strength (RMS energy)
   - Spectral features (clarity, warmth)
   - Speaking pace and rhythm
   - Volume consistency

3. **Scoring Algorithm**:
   - **Confidence Score** (50% weight): Based on voice stability, strength, and clarity
   - **Tone Quality Score** (50% weight): Based on warmth, smoothness, and richness
   - **Final Score**: Combined weighted average (0-100)

4. **Database Storage**: Results saved to `performance_metrics` table:
   - `tone_confidence_score`: Final calculated score
   - `improvement_suggestions`: Personalized feedback text

5. **Feedback Generation**: AI generates specific suggestions based on:
   - Low confidence → "Work on speaking with more conviction"
   - Poor tone quality → "Focus on maintaining a warm and pleasant tone"
   - Pace issues → "Adjust your speaking pace"
   - Volume inconsistency → "Maintain consistent volume"

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Start your backend server:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. Test with curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/audio/analyze" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "audio_file=@path/to/your/audio.wav" \
  -F "session_id=1" \
  -F "question_id=1"
```

### 3. Check the database:
```sql
SELECT * FROM performance_metrics WHERE tone_confidence_score IS NOT NULL;
```

## Frontend Integration

I've created `frontend_audio_integration_example.js` showing how to:
- Record audio using MediaRecorder API
- Upload audio files to the analysis endpoint
- Display results in your UI
- Handle errors gracefully

## Key Features

✅ **Real-time Analysis**: Analyze audio immediately after recording
✅ **Database Integration**: Automatically saves results to performance_metrics table
✅ **Personalized Feedback**: Generates specific improvement suggestions
✅ **Multiple Formats**: Supports wav, mp3, m4a, flac, ogg, aac
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when analysis fails
✅ **Authentication**: Integrated with your existing auth system

## Next Steps

1. **Test the API** with sample audio files
2. **Integrate with your frontend** using the provided example
3. **Customize scoring weights** in `tone_analysis_service.py` if needed
4. **Add real-time analysis** for live interview sessions
5. **Enhance UI** to display detailed scores and suggestions

The feature is now ready to use! The tone confidence score will be automatically calculated and stored in your `performance_metrics` table whenever audio is analyzed.
